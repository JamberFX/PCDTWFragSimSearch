Proteins can exhibit sequence level identity/similarity and also structure level identity.  These are the most common aspects of a protein that are used to identify homologous proteins/regions.  However, the structure and thus function of a protein is determined by the physicochemical properties that each amino acid possesses.  We have found that two physicochemical properties when combined in the right manner can be used along with dynamic time warping to identify similarity among proteins that better transcends the twilight zone than sequence based analyses.  Additionally, this method may have advantages over structure based approaches which are generally expensive in terms of time, computing power and money.
